# Welcome to Loki

(TL;DR) This internal tool makes it easier to track and understand what's going on with your time and labor data. 

Why was this needed?

Before Loki, there was too much database querying taking place to get to information that should be available at a glance. 

Loki eliminates this pain point and delivers information in a visually pleasing manner. 

With Loki, we can work smarter and more easily identify issues or confirm expected results.
